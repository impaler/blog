### [Unix Design Philosophy](http://wiki.c2.com/?UnixDesignPhilosophy)

> a program can eliminate much extraneous code that often results in
> excess overhead, unnecessary complexity, and a lack of flexibility.

### [No Silver Bullet](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf)

> There is no single development, in either technology or management technique,
> which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a
> decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.
>> <cite>FREDERICK P. BROOKS JR.</cite>
