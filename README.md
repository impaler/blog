# blog
My personal blog mostly about tech and development topics.

See it live on [christopherdecoster.com](http://christopherdecoster.com).

This repository contains the posts in markdown format and the image assets.
This content is used to generate a "static site" with the repository [cd-blog-phenomic](https://github.com/impaler/cd-blog-phenomic).
